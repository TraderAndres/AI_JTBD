# prompts/situational_and_complexity_factors.yaml

description: |
  Lists situations or complexities that could make the job more challenging, rated on a scale from 1 (worst case) to 5 (best case).

prompt: |
  Act as a(n) {end_user} who is {job} {context}. Disregard context if it is not supplied. List {n} situations a(n) {end_user} could find themselves in that would make {job} more challenging? Use the perfect experience as a baseline.

  The situation will be rated by survey respondents on a scale of 1 through 5, where 1 will be the worst case and 5 being the best case. The following is an example:

  | Situations/Complexities | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Limited budget - Having a restricted budget for hiring market research firms or purchasing data can limit the depth and breadth of research conducted. | None | | | | Extensive |

  In the example above, “Limited Budget” should be “Budget level for the research.” Only rating level 1 and 5 require a value. In this case, 1 is “None” and the other extreme is “Extensive.”

  Therefore, the outputted result should be:

  | Situations/Complexities | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Budget level for the research | None | | | | Extensive |

  Each situation could need different worst case and best case language. You will need to think that through carefully.

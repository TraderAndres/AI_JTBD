  The term context in problem-solving refers to the surrounding information that is necessary to understand the problem and find a solution. It involves identifying what issues are to be considered as ‘problems’ to solve, exploring and finally deciding on how to think about the problem, assigning responsibility, naming the team, allocating resources, setting the schedule, and naming key stakeholders. The actual effort to solve the problem involves understanding its cause, designing some corrective action, and implementing the solution. It also involves dealing with pragmatics, the way that context contributes to meaning, and semantics, the interpretation of the problem. Observing what is going on in your environment; identifying things that could be changed or improved; diagnosing why the current state is the way it is and the factors and forces that influence it; developing approaches and alternatives to influence change; making decisions about which alternative to select; taking action to implement the changes; and observing impact of those actions in the environment

  Explain each context. Output the context name in bold. Separate the name and explanation with a dash "-" so they are on the same line. Output as a numbered list.

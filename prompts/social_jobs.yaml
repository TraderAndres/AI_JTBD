prompt: |
  Act as a(n) {end_user} who is {job} {context}. Generate a complete list of positive perceptions you want others to have of you while {job} {context}. Explain step-by-step. Begin each desired perception with "Be Perceived as". For example: "Be Perceived as Competent". Then generate a second list of negative perceptions that you do not want others to perceive you as. Explain step-by-step. Begin each undesired perception with "Avoid Being Perceived as". For example: "Avoid Being Perceived as Incompetent".

  Use ### in front of any groupings

  Output as a numbered list

  Use the following example to format the output:

  1. **Be Perceived as Skilled -** Mastery over equipment operation is important. Being seen as skilled implies you can execute tasks without causing damage or delays.

  Disregard context if none is provided

  Next, output the same list in survey format.

  ===begin survey format===

  For each perception, present it in a single table format, e.g., one continuous list. The table should begin with a title row that mentions the job and context. The next row should indicate levels of importance (Not important, Neutral, Important) and difficulty (Not difficult, Neutral, Difficult).

  Please output the emotion in the following single table structure.

  | When {{job}} {{context}}… | How important is it that you are able to… | | | How difficult is it for you to… | | |

  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

  | | Not important | Neutral | Important | Not difficult | Neutral | Difficult |

  | {{perception 1}} | | | | | | |

  | {{perception 2}} | | | | | | |

  | {{perception n}} | | | | | | |

  Always output in markdown

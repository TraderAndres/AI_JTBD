  This prompt generates a list of roles that support the work or services within a specified industry, sector, and subsector. The roles are listed with brief descriptions based on the provided parameters for industry, sector, subsector, fidelity, and number of roles (`n`).

Within the {industry} industry, and then within the {sector} sector, and then within the {subsector} subsector, create a {fidelity} list of {n} related roles that support the work (or service) and include a brief description. For example, within the **Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting industry**, and then within the **Animal Production and Aquaculture** sector, and then within the **Dairy Cattle and Milk Production** subsector the role might be **Dairy Farmer.** The structure of your response should be as follows:

  1. **Role Name**: This is where you describe the role.

  Do not output anything before, or after the list.

  Do theme-up customer types if “n” is small, and break them down when “n” is larger.
  Always output in markdown.

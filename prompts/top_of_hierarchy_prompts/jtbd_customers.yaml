  This prompt generates a list of Jobs-to-be-Done that an end user might aim to accomplish using solutions offered by a specific industry, sector, and subsector. Each job is framed from the perspective of the customer's desired outcomes rather than the company offering the solution. The job statements should begin with a verb ending in "ing" and describe what the end user is ultimately trying to achieve within their role.

prompt: |
  Act as a(n) {end_user} who works in the {industry} industry with a specialty focus in the {sector} sector and {subsector} subsector. I do not want to know what {end_user}s are doing with solutions offered by the industry, sector, and/or subsector. I want to know what they could be ultimately trying to accomplish by using the solutions offered by the industry | sector | subsector given their role as a(n) {end_user}. What they are trying to accomplish should be aligned with their desired outcomes, not the outcomes of the company offering the solution.

  If the industry is Cloud Computing Services, the sector is Software as a Service (SaaS), and the subsector is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software, I don’t want to know that a Marketing Manager “launches marketing campaigns.” I want to know that they are “developing qualified leads.”

  We're going to call what they are trying to accomplish "Jobs-to-be-Done."

  I'd like you to generate a list of {n} jobs that the {end_user} is trying to get done.

  These should be tightly tied to the solutions offered by the industry and/or sector and/or subsector. I don’t want to know about one-offs, or ad-hoc jobs.

  A job statement should begin with a verb ending in "ing" (the gerund form of a verb).

  Do not use general terms that do not have a discrete, tangible output at the beginning of the job statement. An example of such a verb that should never be used is "Managing."

  The following is a non-exhaustive list of common verbs that might be used at the beginning of each functional job. Allocate 80% of the output to these:

  1. Achieving
  2. Allowing
  3. Confirming
  4. Coordinating
  5. Correcting
  6. Creating
  7. Demonstrating
  8. Detecting

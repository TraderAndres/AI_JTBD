- Pass BOTH names and descriptions to prompt variables
- Make sure picks up where left off in saved JSON and maybe stores some value as to the last node processed so knows exactly WHERE to pick up? 
- use function calling for more consistent outputs.
- Upgrade to Mongo for better data management and when link with vector store for search
- parallelize the layers so can get the results MUCH faster.  Need to figure out throughput limits.
